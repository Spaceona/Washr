This is the repository for the code for the Washr sensor to detect if a washing machine is on. 
Originally the code was written in MicroPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, although it has since been migrated to an Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 using Arduino C. 

Right now it contains two main versions of the code, esp32code_v2 and esp32code_v3. V2 is designed to be run in the Arduino IDE, while V3 is designed to be run in PlatformIO. The V2 code is depreciated right now and is mainly used for reference. The V3 code is the most up to date and is the one that is being actively developed.


All the code for the Pico W is in the PicoArchive folder, and is mainly for reference since the Pico version is no longer in active development.

In order to contribute, please create a new branch and make a pull request when ready to merge. The code will be reviewed before it is merged.

Please read all the `ABOUT.md` files in the respective folders for more information on how to set up the code and how to use it.
