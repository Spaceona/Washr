This is the second version of the SpaceOna code for an ESP32, more specifically the Seeed Studio ESP32C3. 
It updated the code architecture to use c++ files to break the fucntions into seperate files to make the code more readable.
It moves the detection algorithm to on the board (DONE with basic version), and adds OTA updates (IN PROGRESS).
